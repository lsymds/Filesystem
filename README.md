# Storio

## STORIO IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. DO NOT USE.

> Welsh for 'Storage'

Storio is a storage and filesystem abstraction layer for modern .NET projects. Stop repeatedly implementing your own
`IFileSystem` only to find it only supports one provider and instead use an extensible, fully tested library that does
it all for you. Use Storio.
